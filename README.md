* Resources used in meat production
 * water (contributes to global water crisis)
  * "It requires at least 15,500 liters of water to produce 1 kilo of beef. In total, meat production demands more than 2,000 trillion tons of water every year (that's 63 million liters a second!). In less than 40 hours thatâ€™s enough to provide drinking water for everyone on earth for a year."
 * waste from cattle and livestock animals
 * greenhouse gas emissions
  * burps and farts from cattle and other livestock animals account for 18% of global greenhouse gas emissions (more than total emissions from transportation sector)
